            <h2>Historical Perspective on Computing</h2>
            <p>When we study the many aspects of computing and computers, it is important to know about the history of computers. Charles Babbage designed an Analytical Engine which was a general computer. It helps us understand the growth and progress of technology through the times. It is also an important topic for competitive and banking exams.</p>
